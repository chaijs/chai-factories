# Chai Factories

This is a addon plugin for the [Chai Assertion Library](http://github.com/logicalparadox/chai).

Chai Factories is a simple straightforward factory builder for your awesome tests.

## Installation

#### Node.js

      $ npm install chai-factories

#### Browser

Include `chai-factories.js` after including `chai.js`.

```html
<script src="chai-factories.js"></script>
```

## Plug In

If you are using `chai-factories` in the browser, there is nothing you need to do. It will detect `chai` in the global
namespace and automagically get used.

If you are using node, here is a useful bit.

```js
var chai = require('chai')
  , factories = require('chai-factories');

chai.use(factories);
```

## Building for the Browser

If you are developing an addon for chai, one thing you might find useful is the contents of the `support` folder.
This directly contains everything that is needed to package all js files in a directory for browser use. Provided
there are no external dependencies, everything will be packaged and wrapped with a CommonJS `require` style loader
by [folio](https://github.com/logicalparadox/folio), a small JS packaging tool. Please consult the comments in `support/compile.js`.

## Usage

#### Register a factory

```js
chai.factory('person', { name: 'John Doe', age: 29 });
chai.factory('cat', { name: 'Boo' });
```
#### Build from factory

```js
var user = chai.create('person');
```

#### Overwrite property

```js
chai.factory('cat', { cute: true, age: 4 });
var cat = chai.create('cat', { cute: false });
```

#### Extend a factory

```js
var cat = chai.factory('cat', { cute: true, age: 4 });
chai.factory('tiger', cat.extend({ scary: true }));
var tiger = chai.create('tiger');
```

## Tests

Tests are written using [mocha](http://github.com/visionmedia/mocha).
Node tests can be executed using `make test`. Browser tests can be seen by opening `test/browser/index.html`.
